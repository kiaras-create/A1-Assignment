# A1 DynamicArray

## Your readme should include the following information. Each student needs to submit all of this information.

Other students you worked with, including TAs: 
Students: Chiashi Yang, Kiara Sunil Singh, Victoria Reyes Borges
TAs: Marybella, Adriana, Molly 

*** WHAT WE FIXED/CHANGED ***
- We renamed the size and get methods to match the requirements so lenArray() -> size() and getEle() -> get().
- We revised the add method and add method tests.
- We revised the extract method. 

If anyone was particularly helpful, please give them a shoutout here: Marybella, Molly, Adriana!!

Reflection on your experience with this assignment:

Chiashi Yang - This assignment was definitely challenging. In particular, I found the generics part to be quite difficult, as I just wasn't used to working with it. In previous CS assignments, we usually had a specific type we were working with. I definitely had to think outside of the box for this assignment. Although it was challenging, I learned a lot about how to build Dynamic Array functions from scratch without importing packages. The splitSuffix and deleteList methods were my favorite to code! This assignment also helped me better understand copy constructors and deep copies, specifically with when to use reassignment.

Victoria Reyes - A1 was challenging! I had a hard time figuring out the generics part and the logic for some methods. However, this assignment helped me a lot in remebering things from 120 that I had forgotten, mostly basic syntax ad concepts. Halfway during our assignment, I finally understood a lot of things that I wish would've been explained a little more during class. Nonethless, I truly believe my java skills are coming back to me thanks to this assignment. 

Kiara Sunil Singh - This assignment was very challenging! Initially, I had a hard time identifying how generics worked and how they interacted with the methods since I wasn't used to using them. It was also a huge mental shift not being able to import any systems and I definitely learned more about each array method and property. I found that going to tutoring and office hours was very helpful since it helped me adjust to new concepts. This assingment helped me understand more about how arrays work logically and improved my java skills.
