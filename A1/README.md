Reflection on your experience with this assignment:

Chiashi Yang - This assignment was definitely challenging. In particular, I found the generics part to be quite difficult, as I just wasn't used to working with it. In previous CS assignments, we usually had a specific type we were working with. I definitely had to think outside of the box for this assignment. Although it was challenging, I learned a lot about how to build Dynamic Array functions from scratch without importing packages. The splitSuffix and deleteList methods were my favorite to code! This assignment also helped me better understand copy constructors and deep copies, specifically with when to use reassignment.

Victoria Reyes - A1 was challenging! I had a hard time figuring out the generics part and the logic for some methods. However, this assignment helped me a lot in remebering things from 120 that I had forgotten, mostly basic syntax ad concepts. Halfway during our assignment, I finally understood a lot of things that I wish would've been explained a little more during class. Nonethless, I truly believe my java skills are coming back to me thanks to this assignment.
