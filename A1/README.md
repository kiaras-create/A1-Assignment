Reflection on your experience with this assignment:

Chiashi Yang - This assignment was definitely challenging. In particular, I found the generics part to be quite difficult, as I just wasn't used to working with it. In previous CS assignments, we usually had a specific type we were working with. I definitely had to think outside of the box for this assignment. Although it was challenging, I learned a lot about how to build Dynamic Array functions from scratch without importing packages. The splitSuffix and deleteList methods were my favorite to code! This assignment also helped me better understand copy constructors and deep copies, specifically with when to use reassignment.
