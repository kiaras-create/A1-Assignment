// JUNIT TESTS

// public T getEle(int index) - method call w/expected return value
// The length of this array is 5. Each index holds an element (char). For instance, the array is B L U E S. 
// The method should return the element at the specific index. In this case, if the user wants to access the element at index 2, the method should return 'U'.
// We will use AssertEqual to check if the expected value aligns with the returned value. The expected value of 'U' and return value of 'U' match, so the test case passes. 

// public T getEle(int index) - method call w/expected exception
// The length of this array is 5. Each index holds an element (char). For instance, the array is B L U E S. 
// The method should return the element at the specific index. In this case, the user wants to access the element at index 5.
// In this case, we will use AssertTrue to test if the requested index is less than the length of the array. However, because the 5th index is out of bounds (exception), the test will fail.

// public T getEle(int index) - method call w/fail test
// The length of this array is 5. Each index holds an element (char). For instance, the array is B L U E S. 
// The method should return the element at the specific index. In this case, if the user wants to access the element at index 2, the method should return 'U'.
// We will again use AssertEqual to check if the expected element aligns with the returned element. However, the elements do not match (expected is 'U' and returned is 'B'), the test will fail.

// public T setEle(int index) - method call w/expected return value
// The length of this array is 5. Each index holds an element (char). For instance, the array is B L U E S. 
// We want to change the element at the 3rd index to an 'I'. The method should return the changed array as B L U I S. 
// We will again use AssertEqual to check if the expected array aligns with the returned array. The expected array of B L U I S and returned array matches, so the test case passes. 

// public T setEle(int index) - method call w/expected exception
// The length of this array is 5. Each index holds an element (char). For instance, the array is B L U E S. 
// We want to store an element at the 5th index. 
// In this case, we will use AssertTrue to test if the index requested is less than the length of the array. However, the 5th index is out of bounds, so the test fails. 

// public T setEle(int index) - method call w/fail test
// The length of this array is 5. Each index holds an element (char). For instance, the array is B L U E S. 
// We want to change the element at the 3rd index to an 'I'. The method should return the changed array as B L U I S. 
// We will use AssertEqual to check if the expected array aligns with the returned array. The expected array (B L U I S) and returned array (B L I E S) do not match, as you made a typo. The test fails.

// public T lenArray(T[] arr) - method call w/expected return value
// The length of this array is 4. Each index holds an element (int). The array contains the ints 1 2 3 4. 
// We want to return the length of the array, which is 4. 
// We will use AssertEqual to check if the expected length matches the returned length. The expected length is 4, and the returned length is 4, so the test passes.
